# Helianthus
[Helianthus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helianthus) is the name I decided to give to my fiancee and I's wedding website. Sunflowers are her favorite, and are going to be a common thread throughout the wedding. It seemed only fair to follow suit here as well. :)

## Contributing
Since this is for my wedding, I will not be accepting any contributions. If you have any suggestions or find any bugs, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/ahoopes16/helianthus/issues/new/choose)!

## Tech Stack
This website is being built using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). I plan on adding a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) API and a [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) to the backend in the future.

I am also taking advantage of [AWS Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/) to manage and deploy my code. If you haven't taken a look at it before, I highly recommend it. For a project like this, it's incredibly easy to get a web application up and running.
